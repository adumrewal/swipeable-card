# Swipeable Cards [Tinder card, Stacked card]:
In the recent times there are a lot of mobile applications which require a stack of swipeable cards. Flutter being a relatively new platform, it is difficult to find multiple options of library which can exclusively satisfy your needs.

## History
For tinder like stacked cards, there exists one popular flutter package called [flutter_tindercard](https://github.com/ShaunRain/flutter_tindercard). It is easy to use and provides exactly what you need. However, in the recent times there has not been a lot of contributions to the repo and you need to import the entire package for use. In this repository I have used codes from flutter_tindercard repo and added the following pros:
- You only need to download one file (code/swipeable-card.dart) and place it in your codebase anywhere
- Having the source code file inside your projects helps you easily modify it according to your use-case
- New features: Change card background color on movement of cards (multiple more use-cases)
- Minor bug fixes
- I will try to maintain this repository actively and feel free to ping if you need some more features

## Dependencies
- None. (only [flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/sdk/releases))
